# Communication-Project
The goal of this project is to demodulate and extract five audio signals from a complex FDMA signal. This involves reading and analyzing the mixed signal's 
time and frequency domains, estimating the bandwidth and carrier frequencies of the individual audio signals, identifying their modulation techniques,
and subsequently demodulating and saving each audio signal as a separate WAV file. Playback and quality assessment are also performed, 
with the option to revise earlier steps if needed, to ensure accurate extraction and proper audio signal recovery.
